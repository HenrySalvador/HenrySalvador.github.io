## The road ahead

The goal: Transition into web development career

	To date I have only stuck a toe into the water in the vast ocean that is the web dev world. Today I set out to strap in and get dirty. One of the first thing I wanted to do to is create a space to blog my journey. In recent years I have found that writing the contents of my mind to be efficient and sorta fun. In reading some posts from lurking reddit and blog posts from all over, it seems there is a consensus that one of the best ways to strengthen your understanding is to writing or teaching about the subject, which is where this blog comes in. Also the whole idea of being able to look back at your progression seems great in times where I will inevitably hit walls and become frustrated.
    
    One crucial place I used to try to set up a soft structure is WhatsDev's [Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sppSnBQVt0k&t=672s). I think this video is invaluable to giving me a bird's eye point of view of what I can expect ahead. I'm so thankful I found this video.
    
    My main resource I will use will be [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com). I consider myself lucky to have found this resource fairly early on in my time of playing around with the whole idea of learning to code. I've seen people who found it after months into their path and wishing they had known about it earlier instead of spending time on outdated, incomplete, or inefficient resources. The big appeal of TOP is that it's project based learning and encourages you to be comfortable and used to not having your handheld the whole way. It let you know from the get go, a web developer's best friend is google and docs, so starting from the beginning you learn to find the way yourself and get accustomed to reading documentation. This seems like the absolute perfect blend that is a self-taught's path of independency and a curriculum structure.
    
    Another big resource I will be using is Harvard's [EDX CS50 Course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). The existence of this was brought to my attention thanks to WhatsDev Roadmap video. While I have seen a few posts saying that this is unnessary, I really think tackling the fundamentals of Computer Science will keep me from hitting some future walls as well as unlocking some future potential going into this field. I fear that going through with the actual assignments might be tough and that I will give into procrastination but with this blog I'm looking forward to writing about each of those assignments and now I feel some obligation and investment into it all.
    
    Some other quick fire resources include:
    FreeCodeCamp:I've only gotten through the html and some css portion in here, and later found out this is part of The Odin Project Curriculum.
    [Dorian Develop's YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DorianDevelops):Dorian's videos is targetted at people new to webdev and people on the sidelines. Alot of his videos touch on subjects that are relevant to me, and ultimately him talking about his journey is what really inspired me to pull the trigger on this thing.
    [Micheal White's YT](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelWhiteDev): Micheal White is something I only discovered in the last few days. He vlogged his progress towards transitioning into a different career field. Seeing someone who let journaled his progress so recently was another inspiration towards pulling the trigger. I haven't seen all the update videos yet but I believe semi-recently Micheal accomplished his goal of his first job.(All his videos being uploaded so recently in under the past year is awesome too) Seeing someone start and finish the path so recently really lights a fire in my belly and makes the road ahead look less daunting. He even has me playing with the idea of vlogging myself, something I never thought I would even consider but this dude's personality and relatability really has me thinking about it.
